<p><b>Access to clean and adequate water sources is a major problem facing the world today.</p></b>
<p><b>Even though water is a renewable resource, its overuse and pollution make it unfit for use.</p></b>
<p><b>Discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage, agricultural chemicals and industrial effluents in water bodies are major contaminants.</p></b>
<p><b>Water pollution can be controlled by treating these effluents suitably before releasing them in water bodies.</p></b>
<p><b>Forest and other vegetation cover slow the surface runoff and replenish underground water.</p></b>
<p><b>Sprinklers effectively irrigate the area by checking water losses through seepage and evaporation.</p></b>
<p><b>In dry regions with high rates of evaporation, drip or trickle irrigation is very useful.</p></b>
<p><b>THE VALUABLE WATER RESOURCE CAN BE CONSERVED BY ADOPTING THESE MEANS OF CONSERVATION.</p></b>
