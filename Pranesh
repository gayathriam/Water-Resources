<p> Water pollution, the release of substance into <u>lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. 
In addition to the release of substances, such as chemicals or microorganisms, water pollution into bodies of water. <u></p>
<p> Water is a renewable resource its overuse and pollution make it unfit for use. </p>
<p> Discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage,agriculture chemicals and industrial 
effluents in water bodies are major contaminantes. </p>
<p> Most of these chemicals are non-biodegradabe and reach human bodies through water. </p>

<p> Climate, land use, local geology, and water quality all affect the availability of fresh water resources in addition to the direct demands people place on them. </p>
<p> The worldâ€™s population is becoming more and more reliant on this precious resource for <b>power, irrigation, industrial practices, and daily consumption.</b> </p>
<p> Fresh water is therefore, the <u>most precious substance on earth.</u> </p>
<p> Water can <b>neither be added nor subtracted</b>
from the earth. Its total volume remains constant.
Its abundance only seems to vary because it is in
constant motion, cycling through the oceans, the
air, the land and back again, through the processes
of <i>evaporation, precipitation and run-off</i> known as <b>Water Cycle.</b> </p>
