<p> Water pollution, the release of substance into <u>lakes, streams, rivers and oceans to the point where the substances 
interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. 
In addition to the release of substances, such as chemicals or microorganisms, water pollution into bodies of water. <u></p>
<p> Water is a renewable resource its overuse and pollution make it unfit for use. </p>
<p> Discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage,agriculture chemicals and industrial 
effluents in water bodies are major contaminantes. </p>
<p> Most of these chemicals are non-biodegradabe and reach human bodies through water. </p>
<p> Industrial waste is one of the biggest sources of water contamination. </p>
<p> Large oil spills and leaks are some of most significant causes of water pollution. These are often caused by oil 
drilling operations in the ocean, but nearly half of the estimated 1 million tons of oil that makes 
its way into marine environments each year come not from oil tankers, but from land-based sources like factories, farms and cities. </p>
<p> 80% of the worldwide wastewater goes back in the environment without being treated or reused.</b> </p>
<p> Water pollution has very negative effects on public health.</b> </p>
